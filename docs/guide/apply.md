Submitting an application for a job opening is easy. Just click the apply button on the opening card and you will be redirected to an application form where in you will be asked for an application letter and other minor details. Additionally, an account is needed before you can submit your application so you have to register first. If you don't have an existing account a registration form will appear inside the application form.
